Description: Utility functions for working with datasets gathered using
    'Open Data Kit' ('ODK') <https://opendatakit.org/>. These include an API to interface with 'ODK Briefcase',
    a 'Java' application for fetching and pushing 'ODK' forms and their contents,
    that allows pulling of data from either a remote 'ODK Aggregate Server' or a
    local 'ODK' folder, a rename function to give more human readable variable
    names for 'ODK' datasets, a merge function to create a single dataframe from a
    nested 'ODK' dataset and an expand function to disaggregate multiple choice
    answers that have been collapsed into single code by 'ODK'.
